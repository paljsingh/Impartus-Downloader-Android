You can use DroidInfo App or other similar apps to find the cpu architecture, and download the matching apk for Impartus-Downloader.

Thumbrule for downloading apk - 

  *arm-v8a* for almost all the recent android phones (except - see below)
  
  *armeabi-v7a* for most phones that are older than a few years (except - see below)
  
  *x86_64* for windows mobile, Asus zenphone and a few of Lenovo models.
  
  *x86* may be none, probably some old ubuntu based phones.
